/// <summary>
/// Validates at host start that EXACTLY ONE <see cref="IActorProvider"/> is registered.
/// The YARP actor-forwarding transform resolves <see cref="IActorProvider"/> per request;
/// without a registered provider, every inbound request would fail with the generic
/// "no service registered" message from <see cref="System.IServiceProvider"/>. Running
/// the check at startup turns a per-request runtime failure into a fail-fast host
/// startup error pointing the operator at the exact misconfiguration.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Pattern mirrors <c>WorkerActorRegistrationValidator</c> in
/// <c>Trellis.Asp.Authorization</c> — both are hosted-lifecycle services that
/// reach into the root services to assert a composition invariant before the host
/// starts accepting traffic. The single-slot enforcement (count == 1, not just
/// count >= 1) is critical: with multiple <see cref="IActorProvider"/> descriptors
/// registered, <see cref="ServiceProviderServiceExtensions.GetRequiredService"/>
/// returns the LAST one, which silently picks an unintended provider and changes the
/// minted Actor / JWT contract — a hard-to-debug authorization regression. Consumers
/// using <c>AddTrellis(o =&gt; o.UseClaimsActorProvider(...))</c> get this protection
/// from <c>TrellisServiceBuilder</c>'s single-slot policy, but consumers calling
/// <see cref="TrellisActorForwardingServiceCollectionExtensions.AddTrellisActorForwarding(Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IReverseProxyBuilder, System.Action{TrellisActorForwardingOptions})"/>
/// directly bypass that gate. This validator restores the invariant for that path.
