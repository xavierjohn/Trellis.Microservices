/// These names match the default <c>TrellisInternalJwtActorOptions</c> values on

/// Centralizing them in a single public class minimizes the risk of operational
/// drift between the gateway operator and the downstream service operator — both
/// sides reference these literals so any future contract version bump is a single
/// coordinated change.

/// Consumers who need different claim names MUST configure both the gateway-side
/// minter AND the downstream <c>TrellisInternalJwtActorOptions</c> in lock-step.

/// Third-party gateway and consumer implementations targeting the same contract
/// MUST reference this package and these literals; freshly typing the strings
